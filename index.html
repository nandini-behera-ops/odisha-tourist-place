    <h2>kalijai tample</h2>
    <p>Kalijai Temple, located on an island in the heart of Chilika Lake near Khallikote, Odisha, is a revered shrine dedicated to Goddess Kalijai, believed to be an incarnation of Goddess Kali. The temple holds deep spiritual and cultural significance among locals, especially fishermen, who consider the goddess their protector. According to legend, a girl named Jaai drowned in the lake during a storm while traveling to her in-laws' home, and her spirit became the deity Kalijai. Built in the early 18th century by King Jagannath Mansingh of Banapur, the temple attracts numerous pilgrims, especially during the Makar Sankranti festival, when a grand fair is held. Accessible only by boat from places like Barkul or Balugaon, the island offers a peaceful, mystical atmosphere and panoramic views of the lake, making it a sacred as well as scenic destination.</p>

    <p> Chilika Lake, located along the eastern coast of Odisha, is Asia’s largest brackish water lagoon and a unique ecological zone teeming with biodiversity. Spanning over 1,100 square kilometers across Puri, Khordha, and Ganjam districts, it is home to the endangered Irrawaddy dolphins, over 160 species of migratory birds, and hundreds of fish species, making it a hotspot for both eco-tourism and bird watching. The lake connects to the Bay of Bengal and supports thousands of local fishermen. Key attractions around the lake include Kalijai Temple, Nalabana Bird Sanctuary, and dolphin-watching at Satapada. During winter, the lake transforms into a haven for migratory birds arriving from as far as Siberia and Central Asia. With its blend of natural beauty, cultural landmarks, and ecological richness, Chilika Lake is one of India’s most treasured wetland ecosystems and a must-visit destination in Odisha.</p>
